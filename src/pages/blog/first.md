# We are now back!

First of all, we apologize to be gone for so long. We didn't really have the time to work on stuff lately, so we had to pause **BarMates** for a while.

Anyways, we are now back again. With a new co-founder, [Eljas Puhakka](https://linkedin.com/in/eljas-puhakka-a07672227) we are ready to continue the business.

Regarding other stuff, I, [Neville Brem](https://github.com/nevthereal), have been reworking the page. We now got this fancy blog, and on top of that, I am busy designing the catalogue page.s

We are hardly working on our products and are excited to launch them for you soon, expectedly within this year.

'Til then, have a nice one!
